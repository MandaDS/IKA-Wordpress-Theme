IKA Theme is a responsive and fully customizable theme, altered via Wordpress\' customizer screen. IKA has the following custom options:

Page Display: Choose between 3 page layouts including single column with top navigation, double column with sidebar hover-over navigation and double column with sidebar slide-down navigation. Page may be aligned to the left, right or center of the browser window. Page width may be fixed or full-width.

Theme Options: Custom header image or text. Backgrounds settings including background image, position, repeat and attachment. Options for image slider including choice of navigation images, slide animation, auto-scroll and slider speed. Most all color options on IKA may be changed including text, text shadow, secondary colors for link hovers and highlights, container colors etc. Customization of the footer including background gradient color and background image accent. 

Widgets: IKA includes 6 custom widgets for 6 widgetized areas. These areas include the main/index page content, sidebar (when applicable) and 4 different footer areas. Widgets included are a main blog feed widget, a featured category blog feed, featured portfolio feed, image slider and copyright display. Some widgets are meant for very specific areas on the theme and will be indicated in the widget title. 

Post Types: IKA has 2 custom post types. A portfolio post type with custom category taxonomy and an image slider to be used in combination with the image slider widget. 

Responsive: IKA theme was built with bootstrap and will automatically respond to changes in browser window size. Note that some aspects of the theme, though responsive, may not cooperate well with mobile browser sizes if user content extends beyond the designated area, mainly concerning the image slider and portfolio image-hover displays. 

== Installation ==
Upload the IKAink Theme folder to your Wordpress themes folder. Visit your appearance page in the wordpress backend to select and customize IKA theme. All aspects of customization can be controlled through the customizer with the exception of adding new slider images or portfolio items.
